Hello darkness, my old friend 你好 黑暗 我的老朋友 

I've come to talk with you again 我又来和你交谈 

Because a vision softly creeping 因为有一种幻觉正向悄悄地向我袭来 

Left its seeds while I was sleeping 在我熟睡的时候留下了它的种子
 
And the vision that was planted in my brain 这种幻觉在我的脑海里生根发芽 

Still remains 缠绕着我 

Within the sound of silence 伴随着寂静的声音 

In restless dreams I walked alone 在不安的梦幻中我独自行走 

Narrow streets of cobblestone 狭窄的鹅卵石街道 

'Neath the halo of a street lamp 在路灯的光环照耀下 

I turned my collar to the cold and damp 我竖起衣领 抵御严寒和潮湿 

When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light 一道耀眼的霓虹灯光刺入我的眼睛 

That split the night 它划破夜空 

And touched the sound of silence 触摸着寂静的声音 

And in the naked light I saw 在炫目的灯光下 

Ten thousand people, maybe more 我看见成千上万的人 

People talking without speaking 人们说而不言 

People hearing without listening 听而不闻 

People writing songs that voices never share 人们创造歌曲却唱不出声来 

And no one dare disturb the sound of silence 没有人敢打扰这寂静的声音
 
"Fools" said I, "You do not know 我说：“傻瓜，难道你不知道
 
Silence like a cancer grows” 寂静如同顽疾滋长” 

Hear my words that I might teach you 听我对你说的有益的话 

Take my arms that I might reach to you 拉住我伸给你的手
 
But my words like silent as raindrops fell 但是我的话犹如雨滴飘落 

And echoed in the wells of silence 在寂静的水井中回响 

And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made. 人们向自己创造的霓虹之神
鞠躬 祈祷

And the sign flashed out its warning 神光中闪射出告诫的语句 

And the words that it was forming 在字里行间指明 

And the sign said: 它告诉人们 

"The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls 预言者的话都已写在地铁的墙上 

and tenement halls 和房屋的大厅里 

And whispered in the sound of silence." 在寂静的声音里低语
